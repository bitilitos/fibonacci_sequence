# Fibonacci sequence calculator

Console/terminal fibonacci sequence element calculator. It was made as an extended exercise from [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).
You can read at the end of chapter 3.5:
> To practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to do the following:
> - Generate the nth Fibonacci number.


## Capabilities
This small program is able to calculate the nth Fibonacci number and the elapsed time to do the calculations.\n
Theoretically 0 < n < 4294967295, limited by n:u32. However I've only tested up to n = 1 000 000.
> The calculation algorithm of the 1000000th fibonacci element took 65.457878488s.
